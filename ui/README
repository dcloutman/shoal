This library contains PHP classes that can be populated with data in the
presentation logic portion of an application, and then be echoed inside a
template. The result HTML 5 compatible and XHTML 1.0 friendly markup that is
syntactically correct and semantically optimized. It eliminates the bugs that
can be intruduced by manually inserting scalar values into hand coded HTML.

The library currently implements the most commonly used form controls only.
It may or may not be extended in the furture, but is intended to be extensible 
for any HTML element.

Objects do not use traditional getter / setter interface. Rather, they
implement a jQuery style fluid interface. Attrbutes get / set methods 
typically share the name of the attribute. Where and attibute name conflicts
with a PHP keyword or function, it is appended with the extension "_att".
(I.e, the attribute "for" on the <label> tag is accessed by the for_att()
method.)
